# Ruby Drill Accessor Methods 
 
##Learning Competencies 

* Use instance variables and accessor methods effectively
* Work with objects in Ruby

##Summary 

 Ruby provides a handy shortcut for creating *accessor methods*.  Read [this Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5046831/why-use-rubys-attr-accessor-attr-reader-and-attr-writer) on how they work.

##Releases
###Release 0 : Replace with attr_helpers

Read over the Ruby program provided until you understand the basic structure. Then load it into IRB or [PRY](http://pryrepl.org/) and play around with it.

Next, identify which methods could be replaced with an `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, or `attr_accessor` helper and do it.

Write driver code to ensure your code still works in the same way.  The purpose of this challenge is to refactor for clarity and concision, not alter the behavior of the program.
